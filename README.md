# Customer Segmentation and Classification Using Machine Learning
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify customers into different segments based on various features such as age, profession, spending score, etc.
We applied multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.), and found that Gradient Boosting produced the best accuracy.


## Dataset
- train.csv: The dataset used for training the model.
- test.csv: The dataset used for making predictions.
